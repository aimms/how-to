The **Academic License** is designed for students, educators, and researchers who 
wish to use AIMMS for non-commercial, educational purposes. 
This license provides access to the full suite of AIMMS tools, 
enabling users to create models and run optimization projects in 
academic environments. It is available at no cost or at a reduced 
rate and is ideal for classroom use, academic research, or coursework.

The **Community License** offers free access to AIMMS for individual users 
and small projects. This license is available for non-commercial purposes 
and provides essential AIMMS functionalities with some limitations compared 
to commercial licenses. Itâ€™s an excellent choice for individuals, hobbyists, 
or small groups who want to explore AIMMS or work on open-source or non-profit projects.
