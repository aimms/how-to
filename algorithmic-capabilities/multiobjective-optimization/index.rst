**Multi-Objective Optimization** in AIMMS enables users to address problems involving multiple, often conflicting objectives. 
It provides tools for exploring trade-offs, generating Pareto-efficient solutions, and balancing diverse goals in areas like project 
selection, resource allocation, and portfolio optimization.

Here, you can find documentation about it:
