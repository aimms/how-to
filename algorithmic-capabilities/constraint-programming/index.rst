**Constraint Programming** is a powerful modeling approach in AIMMS, designed for solving combinatorial problems by defining 
constraints on decision variables. It is particularly effective for problems like scheduling, resource allocation, and vehicle routing, 
offering flexibility and efficiency in exploring feasible solutions.
