The **Generic Modeling Programming** (GMP) feature in AIMMS enables advanced model manipulation, allowing users to dynamically 
modify optimization problems. GMP facilitates scenario analysis, decomposition, and algorithm customization, offering a 
flexible approach to building scalable and adaptive optimization solutions.
