Miscellaneous: Multistart
===========================

Direct download AIMMS Project :download:`multistart <https://download.aimms.com/aimms/download/examples/multistart.zip>`

Go to the example on GitHub:
https://github.com/aimms/examples/tree/master/Practical%20Examples/Miscellaneous/Multistart

Problem type:
NLP (small)

Keywords:
Multistart, Starting point, GMP, 3D chart, Network object

Description:
This example demonstrates the AIMMS multistart algorithm. On the first
page the heat map of the non-convex objective funtion is plotted. On
the second page the impact of starting points is demonstrated. On the
third and last page the multistart algorithm is demonstrated step by
step.

Note:
The example demonstrates the basic algorithm as described in chapter
'Advanced Methods for Nonlinear Programs' in the `Language Reference <https://documentation.aimms.com/aimms_ref.html>`_
