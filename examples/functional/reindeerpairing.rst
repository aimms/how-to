This AIMMS project is an illustration of the stable marriage problem. The problem formulation is originally stated elegantly at Tallys Yunes' blog:

The GUI of this AIMMS project illustrates the use of a network object with a background and data/names are filled in at particular points. 
- Choose left or right perspective in order to order the reindeer either using the order in the set of left reindeer (Lefty) or right reindeer (Righty).
- Choose a solution to view a different solution.

The art work used in the background is graciously provided by Dixie Allen. She retains the copy right of it: Art � Dixie Allan, webclipart.about.com
