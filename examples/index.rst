Examples
===========

If you have any questions about AIMMS in general or about how to get the most out of AIMMS for your problem, you can ask
them on our `community <https://community.aimms.com/>`_.

This section contains several types of AIMMS examples:

* Examples from the AIMMS Modeling Book
* Functional examples demonstrating particular AIMMS features
* AIMMS-style application examples including an end-user UI
* Practical examples, including references to the articles on which each example is based

Each example is stored in a separate folder containing:

* An ``about.txt`` or ``description.txt`` file that briefly describes the model or functionality illustrated in the example
* An ``.aimms`` file which listing the main project and all library folders included in the example
* An ``.ams`` file containing the model source describing the AIMMS model

The examples projects can only be opened in AIMMS 4.0 (or higher) through the ``.aimms`` file. To get an overview of the 
underlying optimization model you can also directly view the ``.ams`` model source file.

All examples are `on github <https://github.com/aimms/examples>`_ and can be downloaded in one :download:`AIMMS examples master file <https://github.com/aimms/examples/archive/master.zip>`. Or, you can clone the entire repository.
