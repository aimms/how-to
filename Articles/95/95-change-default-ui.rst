In AIMMS versions 4.40.1 and higher, WebUI is the default user interface. When creating a new project, AIMMS gives you the option to select a default UI and if WinUI is not selected, the *Page Manager* will not be available in your project. This article outlines how to re-enable the *Page Manager* in your AIMMS project.
