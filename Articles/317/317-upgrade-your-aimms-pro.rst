Even though, the AIMMS PRO installation and upgrade processes are designed to be easy, we advice 
for first-time PRO installation or upgrade, contact our `Support Team <support@aimms.com>`_ to ensure proper planning and support.

Use the installer available from the `AIMMS Downloads page <https://www.aimms.com/downloads#aimms-pro-download>`_.


Prerequisites
---------------

AIMMS PRO requires `Universal Runtime <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2999226/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows>`_ from **version 2.28** onwards.

Windows 10 comes with this runtime pre-installed. However, some versions or installations of Windows do not include it. 

To manually install the Universal Runtime on the machine that hosts AIMMS PRO, please follow the instructions from `Microsoft <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3118401/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows>`_ .
