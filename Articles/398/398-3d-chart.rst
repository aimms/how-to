This example illustrates some of the possibilities of the 3D Chart in AIMMS. Like the 2D chart, the 3D chart supports different styles: bar, scatter, and surface. In this example only the surface style is used.

The slider object is also used in this example. With the slider you can assign a value to a scalar parameter. 

The second 3D Chart example is based on the Complementarity Model example available in :doc:`optimization-modeling-components/mixed-complementarity-problems/complementaryvariable-declaration-and-attributes`.
