Deploying AIMMS set functionality to composite objects
=================================================================

This is a companion article to :doc:`../526/526-modeling-composite-objects`.

AIMMS provides extensive functionality on sets and elements, including, among others:

#.  `element parameters <https://documentation.aimms.com/language-reference/non-procedural-language-components/parameter-declaration/index.html>`_,

#.  `element valued functions <https://documentation.aimms.com/language-reference/non-procedural-language-components/set-set-element-and-string-expressions/set-element-expressions.html#intrinsic-functions-for-sets-and-set-elements>`_,

#.  `element valued iterative operators <https://documentation.aimms.com/language-reference/non-procedural-language-components/set-set-element-and-string-expressions/set-element-expressions.html#element-valued-iterative-expressions>`_,

#.  `set valued iterative operators <https://documentation.aimms.com/language-reference/non-procedural-language-components/set-set-element-and-string-expressions/set-expressions.html#iterative-set-operators>`_, and

#.  `indexed sets <https://documentation.aimms.com/language-reference/non-procedural-language-components/set-declaration/set-declaration-and-attributes.html#indexed-sets>`_.

Can this functionality be used in the two approaches to model composite objects?

The component based approach to support AIMMS set semantics for composite objects
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The component based approach is not sufficient to support the above mentioned functionalities.

The first three functionalities enumerated above result in single elements; so they cannot be used to select multiple components, whereby each component is an element in itself.
The last three functionalities enumerated above result in subsets of a single set of varying length ; so they cannot be used to select multiple components whereby the elements may come from different sets.

The reference element based approach to support AIMMS set semantics for composite objects
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The reference element based approach is sufficient to support the above mentioned functionalities.

As each reference element is an element in an AIMMS set, and a reference element references a composite object; the reference element based approach for composite objects can be used in conjunction with AIMMS set semantics. This is illustrated in the remainder of this section.

As the set ``s_arcIds`` is an ordinary set, we can use it everywhere an AIMMS set can be used; for instance in the following declarations:

.. code-block:: aimms
    :linenos:

    DeclarationSection Declarations_for_set_semantic_support_of_reference_based_approach {
        Parameter p_totArcFlow {
            IndexDomain: i_arc;
        }
        ElementParameter ep_arbitraryArc {
            Range: s_arcIds;
        }
        ElementParameter ep_maxOutFlowArc {
            IndexDomain: i_node;
            Range: s_arcIds;
        }
        Set s_fewOrderedArcsByFlow {
            SubsetOf: s_arcIds;
            OrderBy: user;
        }
        Set s_outgoingArcs {
            IndexDomain: i_node;
            SubsetOf: s_arcIds;
        }
    }

With these declarations, the existing AIMMS Language can be used:

.. code-block:: aimms
    :linenos:

    Procedure MainExecution {
        Body: {
            p_totArcFlow(i_arc) := sum( i_tp, v_flow2(i_tp, i_arc) );

            ep_arbitraryArc := Element( s_arcIds, 
                round( uniform(1, card( s_arcIds ) ) ) );

            ep_maxOutFlowArc(i_node) := 
                argMax( i_arc | ep_arcNodeFrom( i_arc ) = i_node, 
                    p_totArcFlow(i_arc) );

            s_fewOrderedArcsByFlow := NBest( i_arc, p_totArcFlow(i_arc), 4 );

            s_outgoingArcs( i_node ) := 
                { i_arc | ep_arcNodeFrom( i_arc ) = i_node };
        }
    }

Remarks on the above code:

#.  Line 3: Ordinary summation.

#.  Line 5, 6: Just selecting an arbitrary arc.

#.  Line 8-10: Here we can select the outgoing arc over which the maximum flow is per node.

#.  Line 12: Using the NBest operator, we can select a few arcs based on flow amount.

#.  Line 14, 15: Filling an indexed set; for each node the set of outgoing arcs.

Summary
-------------

Clearly, the reference element based approach is superior to the component based approach when set operations are relevant for a collection of composite objects.
