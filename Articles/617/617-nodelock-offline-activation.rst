Activate Machine Nodelock Offline
====================================

When AIMMS cannot make a connection to the internet license server to activate a nodelock, you will get the option to activate a nodelock offline. 

To complete offline nodelock activation, follow these steps:

Create Request File
-------------------

1. Start AIMMS, go to License Configuration, and click *Install License*. This will give you the following screen:

3. Enter the activation code for your license number and click *Next*.
