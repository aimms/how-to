An AIMMS Developer license can only be used on one machine at a time. 
There may be situations where you need to use AIMMS on a different machine, either temporarily or permanently. 
This article explains how to transfer an AIMMS license for use on a different computer.

Reach out to our support team at support@aimms.com if you do not have access to the machine on which the 
AIMMS license is currently installed on, or if you encounter any issues in the below process.

.. important::
   * This applies to Personal Nodelock activated licenses as AIMMS Developer licenses are typically installed through the Personal Nodelock method.
   * For Free Academic license users, make sure that the license activation process is done within your university network.

   *  Choose the Personal Nodelock method if this license was activated as one before. If the license was activated as a Machine Nodelock, you can only choose that option for future activations.
