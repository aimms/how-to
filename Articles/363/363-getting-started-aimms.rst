AIMMS Game Challenge
---------------------
Extend your AIMMS knowledge and modeling skills with an AIMMS based-game. It follows a witch apprentice who rises in rank in the witches' guild by solving increasingly difficult modeling and AIMMS assignments.

The game is played in a developer version of AIMMS. Each level includes a tutorial explaining the AIMMS functionality used.

Completion of each A-level provides you with the password needed to enter the next level. A-levels focus on optimization modeling, while B-levels focus on AIMMS functionality.

.. note::
	Level 2b uses a MS Access database and therefore we advise you to download a 32-bit version of AIMMS. However 32-bit versions are only available in older versions. We are working to update this tutorial to be compatible with the newest versions of AIMMS.
