This article gives you an overview of the folder structure of an AIMMS project, and how to share your project with other developers.


AIMMS project folder structure
----------------------------------

When you create a new AIMMS project, multiple folders and files are initialized. The project folder, or the root folder will have the name you specified (*Demo* in the below example).

The below three files are always created and necessary to open an AIMMS project. 

#. ``Demo.aimms`` : this is an executable (if the AIMMS Launcher is installed) file which launches the AIMMS Developer IDE. 
#. ``Demo.ams`` : the model source file which contains all the identifier declarations created in an AIMMS project. Version control systems track this file to track changes made in your model. 
#. ``Project.xml`` : contains information about the version of the AIMMS project and links the ``Demo.aimms`` file to the ``Demo.ams`` file. 

.. code-block:: xml
   :linenos:

   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <Project AimmsVersion="4.63.2.5 unicode x64" ProjectUUID="D3D989F2-FB95-4F29-98E6-A56D9DD245A7">
      <ModelFileName>Demo.ams</ModelFileName>
      <AutoSaveAndBackup>
         <DataBackup AtRegularInterval="true" EveryNMinutes="15" NumBackupsDatedToday="3" NumDaysBeforeToday="3" />
      </AutoSaveAndBackup>
   </Project>

So, the ``<ModelFileName>`` in line #3 of the ``Project.xml`` file should always be same as the name of the ``.ams`` file, both of which are inside the MainProject folder. When you click on ``Demo.aimms`` file, it will load the ``Demo.ams`` file into the IDE as specified in the ``Project.xml`` file. 

If any libraries are added to the project, additional files and folders will be created in the root folder or inside the MainProject folder. 

Sharing a project
--------------------
To share your project with other developers, you need to zip the entire project folder (not just the ``.aimms`` file). 

Right-click on the project folder and go to *Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder*. 

The resulting ZIP file will contain all of the project files in a more portable format.

.. note::

   If you have imported data from external sources, such as Excel files or databases, 
   it is also helpful to share a data case file in your project.

   To save a data case go to *Data > Save Case as*.
