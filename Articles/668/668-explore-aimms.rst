An AIMMS application consists of a mathematical model and a user interface. 

You will use the AIMMS IDE with the AIMMS Community License to develop the model and the browser-based WebUI to design the interface. 

To get started, follow our e-learning course `Modeling with AIMMS I <https://elearning.aimms.com/course/modeling-with-aimms-i>`_, which guides you step-by-step in creating a simple application that runs locally.
