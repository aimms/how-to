Problem type:
MIP (small)

Description:
Lot-sizing problems are production planning problems in which the periods
are a priori, and production of an item in a given period implies some
discrete event such as payment of a cost or the loss of a amount of
production capacity, due to placement of an order, or the set-up, startup,
or changeover of a machine.
