   :keywords: multi objective, CPLEX

In this article we will compare a multi-objective approach to separately solving single objectives.

Let's take for an example a problem trying to find a healthy diet for a reasonable price. First let's define our objectives:

* minimize calories: I'm trying to lose some weight, so my healthy diet should be low in calories.

* minimize price: a reasonable price means that it doesn't have to be the absolute minimum, but should be within a close range.

Of course, I want to include minimum/maximum requirements for nutrients such as proteins. Please use the following project to follow this article:

Multi-Objective Approach
-------------------------

Let's use the multi-objective feature available since AIMMS 4.65 and CPLEX 12.9. 

.. code-block:: aimms

    Procedure SolveMultiObj {
        Body: {
            ep_GMP := gmp::Instance::Generate( DietProblem );
            
            p_retcode := GMP::Column::SetAsMultiObjective(
                GMP      :  ep_GMP, 
                column   :  TotalCost, 
                priority :  2, 
                weight   :  1, 
                abstol   :  0, 
                reltol   :  0.1);
            if not p_retcode then raise error "Unable to set TotalCost as an objective" ; endif ;
            
            p_retcode := GMP::Column::SetAsMultiObjective(
                GMP      :  ep_GMP, 
                column   :  TotalCalories, 
                priority :  1, 
                weight   :  1, 
                abstol   :  0, 
                reltol   :  0.0);
            if not p_retcode then raise error "Unable to set TotalCalories as an objective" ; endif ;
            
            GMP::Instance::Solve( ep_GMP );
        }
    }
    
There are several remarks on the above:

#. Because the ``TotalCost`` objective has a higher priority value, it will be solved first.

#. Because the ``reltol`` argument on line 11 has value 0.1, subsequent solves will not increase the total cost by more than 10%.

Single Objective Approach
-------------------------

To be able to compare the multi-objective procedure to traditional single objective solves, there are also two solution procedures in this application:

#. ``MainExecution``, a traditional single objective solve minimizing total cost.

#. ``SolveMinCalo``, a traditional single objective solve minimizing total calories.

Comparing Results
------------------

The application has both WinUI and WebUI interfaces, but WebUI is featured in the following screenshots.

    Results after minimizing total cost

    :align: center

    Results after running multi objective
    
The objectives are summarized in the table below:

+--------------------------+-------------+----------------+
|                          | Cost        | Calories       |
+==========================+=============+================+
| Minimize total cost      |  21.85      |  2698.40       |
+--------------------------+-------------+----------------+
| Minimize total calories  |  29.80      |  2546.40       |
+--------------------------+-------------+----------------+
| Multi objective          |  23.85      |  2576.40       |
+--------------------------+-------------+----------------+

As you can see, the multi-objective values are not as good as either of the individual objective values, but the multi-objective approach provides a good balance.

You may also find the CPLEX log interesting, as found in the file ``log/cplex 12.9.sta``.

A breakdown of above log:

* lines 1 - 4 for the first solve (minimize total cost)
* lines 6 - 9 for the second solve (minimize total calories)
* lines 11 - 28 for the multi objective solve.
