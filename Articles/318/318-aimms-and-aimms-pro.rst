There is a dependency between AIMMS Developer versions and AIMMS PRO On-Premise versions. The version dependencies are minimal, but in some cases an upgrade of one product requires upgrade of the other.

In addition, some functionality requires upgrades in both AIMMS Developer and in AIMMS PRO On-Premise. 


These version dependencies are listed below:

#.  If you want to deploy AIMMS projects created using AIMMS 4.88 or newer, you will need AIMMS PRO On-Premise 2.44 or newer.

#.  ``pro::storage::ExistsObject`` and ``pro::storage::ExistsBucket`` require at least AIMMS PRO On-Premise 2.33 and AIMMS Developer 4.69

#.  If you want to deploy AIMMS Developer 4.66 or higher, you will need AIMMS PRO On-Premise 2.28 or newer.

#.  **Solver Lease**: Requires at least AIMMS PRO On-Premise 2.25 and AIMMS Developer 4.57

#.  If you want to use AIMMS Developer versions 4.38 or higher, you should use PRO 2.15 or higher. 
    Lower PRO versions are incompatible with these AIMMS Developer versions.
