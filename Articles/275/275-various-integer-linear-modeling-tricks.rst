Modeling problems with an (integer) linear program sometimes requires some experience to recognize certain structures in the problem description that can be formulated in a linear way. 


On the website of the `Naval Postgraduate School <http://faculty.nps.edu/vitae/cgi-bin/vita.cgi>`_, you can find the document :download:`Formulating Integer Linear Programs: A Roguesâ€™ Gallery <http://faculty.nps.edu/dell/docs/Brown_Dell_INFORMS_Transactions_on_Education_January2007.pdf>` that tries to demystify the art of formulating linear and integer linear programs. They do this by introducing formulettes, which consist of a verbal description and the constraints and variables that model this verbal description.

The first simple example of a formulette they provide is the following:


    *For each unit of* :math:`X_1` *, there must be at least 5 units of* :math:`X_2`


which can be modeled with

:math:`5X_1 \le X_2`

The document contains a lot more of such formulettes of varying complexity.

Furthermore, in our book :download:`Optimization Modeling <https://documentation.aimms.com/_downloads/AIMMS_modeling.pdf>` you can also find various modeling tricks in the chapters :download:`Linear Programming Tricks <https://download.aimms.com/aimms/download/manuals/AIMMS3OM_LinearProgrammingTricks.pdf>` and :download:`Integer Programming Tricks <https://download.aimms.com/aimms/download/manuals/AIMMS3OM_IntegerProgrammingTricks.pdf>`. The Optimization Modeling book can either be found online via the link above, or you can find it under the Help menu after you started AIMMS.
