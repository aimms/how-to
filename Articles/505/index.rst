*A One-Hour Tutorial for Beginners*

.. rubric:: Ways to learn AIMMS :math:`\ldots`

There are several ways in which you can learn the AIMMS language and get
a basic understanding of its underlying development environment. The
following opportunities are immediately available.

-  There are two *tutorials* on AIMMS to provide you with some initial
   working knowledge of the system and its language. One tutorial is
   intended for beginners (the current one you are reading), 
   while `the other <https://academy.aimms.com/course/view.php?id=45>`__ 
   is aimed at building a first full application. You may register on the `AIMMS Academy <http://academy.aimms.com/>`__ to use it.

-  There is an `example library <https://how-to.aimms.com/examples/index.html>`__ with a variety of examples to illustrate
   simple and advanced applications together with particular aspects of
   both the language and the graphical user interface.

-  There are three *references* on AIMMS

      - :doc:`ug:index` to introduce you to AIMMS and its development environment, 
      - :doc:`lr:index` to describe the modeling language in detail, and
      - `Optimization Modeling <https://manual.aimms.com/_downloads/AIMMS_modeling.pdf>`__ to enable you to become familiar with building models.

.. rubric:: :math:`\ldots` for beginners

As a beginner into optimization modeling languages, you may not have
much time for learning yet another tool in order to finish some project
or homework requirements. In this case, concentrate your efforts on this
tutorial. After completing this tutorial, you should be able to use the
system to build your own simple models, and to enter your own small data
sets for subsequent viewing. The book on `Optimization Modeling <https://manual.aimms.com/_downloads/AIMMS_modeling.pdf>`__ may
teach you some useful tricks, and will show you different (mostly
non-trivial) examples of optimization models.
