   :description: The AIMMS Unit Test Library provides a framework for implementing unit tests within AIMMS projects, facilitating test-driven development and ensuring code reliability. 

The **Unit Test Library** provides a comprehensive framework for incorporating unit tests directly into AIMMS projects. 
This library supports test-driven development (TDD) by enabling developers to validate individual components and functions of their 
optimization models before full-scale implementation. With AIMMS Unit Test Library, users can define test cases, automate testing procedures, 
and execute them in isolation to ensure that each model component performs as expected. By facilitating the creation of unit tests, 
this library helps maintain code quality, identify potential issues early in the development process, and ensure the reliability of 
optimization models over time.
