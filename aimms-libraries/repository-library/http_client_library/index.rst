The AIMMS HTTP Client Library allows AIMMS applications to communicate with web services and APIs over the HTTP protocol. 
It enables the sending and receiving of data between AIMMS models and external web services, enhancing the capability to integrate real-time data and perform web-based interactions. 
This library is useful for incorporating external data sources, automating data exchanges, and expanding the functionality of AIMMS applications through web connectivity.
