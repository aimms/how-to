The **DataExchange Library** (DEX) is a versatile tool that enables seamless integration between AIMMS models and various data formats 
commonly used in REST APIs. It facilitates the mapping of multi-dimensional AIMMS data onto tree-based formats such as JSON, YAML, XML, 
and table-based formats like CSV, Excel, and Parquet. By allowing users to define mappings that describe the structure of these data formats, 
DEX simplifies the process of reading data into AIMMS identifiers and writing model data to external files. 
Additionally, DEX includes an HTTP client for interacting with REST APIs and supports exposing AIMMS procedures as RESTful services, 
enhancing the model's connectivity and integration capabilities.
